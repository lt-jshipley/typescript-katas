## Kata: BirthdayCalendar

#### Challenge

> Let’s bring together everything that you have learned and create a mini-api for a birthday events calendar! We'll only have it create the events, someone else can make the frontend to display them.

**Rules Breakdown**

> A global scope array that holds birthday calendar events.

> The information on the birthday calendar events is: id: number, name: string, birthday: DateTime, allowDisplay: boolean. Id is autogenerated when an event is created.

> A function that allows us to add a birthday to the collection of events.

> A function that allows us to remove a birthday event by passing in the id of the event.

> A function that allows one to opt-in or opt-out of being displayed on the final print out based on the id of the event and opt-in/opt-out value passed in.

> A function that prints out all of the birthdays with the birthday person’s current age based on the year passed in to the function. What should be printed out is:
- (1) Oscar, 40 y/o [ April, 1st ]
- (2) Big Bird, 17 y/o [ February, 27th ]
- … etc

**Additional Information**

> In the code preload the data with 3 different birthday events, on different dates, years, and names.

> Make sure it is OK to deal with info for different people that have the same name and it does not overwrite prior events.

> Make sure the demo performs a variety of the different actions it can do to showcase the code works properly.
