## Kata: FizzBuzz

#### Challenge

> Create a function that takes in a number as a parameter and returns an output based on what was sent in. Everytime a number passed in is diviisble by 3, then return "fizz". Everytime a number passed in is divisible by 5, then return "buzz". However, when the number passed in is divisible by both 3 and 5, then return "fizzbuzz".

> Wrap the exercise up by calling fizzbuzz from 1 to 100, confirming the outputs are correct.

**Rules Breakdown**
- If a number is divisible by 3, return "fizz" rather than the number.
- If a number is divisible by 5, return "buzz" rather than the number.
- If a number is divisible by 3 and 5, return "fizzbuzz" rather than the number.
- if it does not fall into those rules, return the number without changing it.
- Run fizzbuzz from 1 to 100.
